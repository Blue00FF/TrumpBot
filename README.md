# TrumpBot

(Inspired by an idea by Karolina Sowinska)

In this project, the aim is to create an intelligent bot in Python that uses Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to train on a kaggle Trump twitter insults database. Typically bots are also trained on responding to greetings, but since I am training a bot on insults I thought it a little out of character that it would politely greet you to then potentially start spouting insults left and right. 

To use it you run the "main.py" program, type your response every time you see "You: " on the console and then press enter to see what the bot's response is. The responses are of course far from human but they are pertinent enough to the user responses that I consider this experiment successful.
